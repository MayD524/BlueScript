- Rework If statements
    do it recursively


idea 1:


how to segment these if's?
how can we make them into different partt?


would that work?

if == read_logic:
    parse_logic()

---rework mem?
---    - too much no need to touch memory

recursion
    - how do i pass the lines?
    - where do i add (pre-read or runtime?)
        - pre-read
            - make logic "chunks"
        -runtime
            - easier to add
            - pass all lines


concept to add
if block
    if block
        if block
        endif
    endif
endif
